# WaterAI
A ML model to predict potential water restriction warnings in Taiwan.

This predictive model forecasts water restriction levels across regions in Taiwan. Key variables include future dates, cumulative rainfall from the previous month, projected reservoir storage rates, and geographic coordinates. The prediction results are rounded and classified into 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, representing normal water conditions, slightly tight water conditions, first-stage restrictions, second-stage restrictions, and third-stage restrictions, respectively.
